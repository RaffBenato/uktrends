        <h2 class="h2in">Shopping for Kettles with Boris</h2>
        <p class="pin"> During a speech in Suffolk last week our All Powerful Leader
          announced that if you have an old kettle that takes ages to boil,
          it may cost you £20 to replace it, but if you get a new one,
          you’ll save £10 a year every year on your electricity bill. During
          the current cost of living crisis which was probably caused by the
          Labour Government that left power a mere 12 years ago, every
          little helps, as our supermarket friends would say, so having such
          insightful advice is essential. <br> When shopping for a new kettle it is important to keep a few things in mind, since this is an essential bit of kit will not only save you a fortune on your bills but it will also help reduce the amount of sewage that you will be drinking while enjoying a hot cuppa. Our leader is on his way out due to an extremely high amount of back-stabbing members in the Conservative Party and we eagerly await to find out if his replacement will be as keen as he is in ensuring our waterways are filled with excrement. <br> So lets have a look at a few options when shopping for that new kettle for your kitchen.

          <h2 class="producth2">The Brexit kettle</h2>
          <p class="pin">This is probably the kettle for us plebs suffering the consequences of the Will of the People. Brexit has brought our great nation many benefits, unfortunately we are still waiting for Jacob Rees-Mogg to announce them, but as soon as he does we will ensure you find out what they are. This kettle is one of the cheapest on Amazon but gets the job done. Take back control and enjoy a lovely cup of tea or a cup of boiling water if you are feeling the pinch like us and can't afford tea. <a class="shoplink" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">Visit Shop</a></p>
