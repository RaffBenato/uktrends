            <div class="storymain">
              During a speech in Suffolk last week our All Powerful Leader
              announced that if you have an old kettle that takes ages to boil,
              it may cost you £20 to replace it, but if you get a new one,
              you’ll save £10 a year every year on your electricity bill. During
              the current cost of living crisis which was probably caused by the
              Labour Government that left power a mere 12 years ago, every
              little helps, as our supermarket friends would say, so having such
              insightful advice is essential. <br />
              When shopping for a new kettle it is important to keep a few
              things in mind, since this is an essential bit of kit will not
              only save you a fortune on your bills but it will also help reduce
              the amount of sewage that you will be drinking while enjoying a
              hot cuppa. Our leader is on his way out due to an extremely high
              amount of back-stabbing members in the Conservative Party and we
              eagerly await to find out if his replacement will be as keen as he
              is in ensuring our waterways are filled with excrement.
