        <h2 class="h2in">Liz Truss, The Dairy Queen is in!</h2>
        <p class="pin">  We finally have a new Prime Minister. Even though Boris was doing
          a great job throwing grenades and parties and being flown around
          in jets through the summer, while the country struggled with the
          Cost of Living crisis and the prospect of not being able to heat
          theirs homes this winter. The Conservative party has finally
          decided who will lead our great nation after a long and
          depressingly boring fight between Dishy Rishi and Thick Lizzy and
          the winner is our own Dairy Queen. You will remember almost
          nothing about Liz Truss apart from her haunting staged pictures
          and her famous speech about
          cheese(very...long...awkward...pause...)That. Is. A. Dis-grace.
          The wooden politician delivered this notorious speech during the
          Conservative Party Conference in 2014 but it will stay in our
          nightmares forever. Using our new leader passion for the dairy
          product as inspiration, we look at a few products that will help
          you enjoy your cheese even more.

          <h2 class="producth2">The Brexit kettle</h2>
          <p class="pin">This is probably the kettle for us plebs suffering the consequences of the Will of the People. Brexit has brought our great nation many benefits, unfortunately we are still waiting for Jacob Rees-Mogg to announce them, but as soon as he does we will ensure you find out what they are. This kettle is one of the cheapest on Amazon but gets the job done. Take back control and enjoy a lovely cup of tea or a cup of boiling water if you are feeling the pinch like us and can't afford tea. <a class="shoplink" href="https://amzn.to/3TUhKNr">Visit Shop</a></p>

          <h2 class="producth2">Glass kettle</h2>
          <p class="pin">This elegant kitchen appliance should be your choice if you are short of money to take the kids out for activities. You can all sit around the kettle watching the bubbles as the water boils. As a bonus you will all be keeping each other warm as the central heating will definitely be off this winter.   <a class="shoplink" href="https://amzn.to/3BsmK4y">Visit Shop</a></p>

          <h2 class="producth2">Carrie's choice</h2>
          <p class="pin">This model is a must have if like Carrie you want to impress your friends when they come over to see the new refurbished flat. It does everything that the other ones do but it costs a lot more, which should not be a problem if you are not paying for it anyway. Make sure to have it somewhere visible so that the husband's old Eton friends know you are not poor when they come over for a shooting weekend.<a class="shoplink" href="https://amzn.to/3xdpfW1">Visit Shop</a></p>
